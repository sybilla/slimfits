# slimfits
JavaScript library for loading data stored in [FITS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS) data format. FITS files are commonly used in astronomical observations to store scientific data.

# Prerequisites

- Node.js

# Consuming from npm

`npm install slimfits`

and to install typings:

`typings install github:sybilla/slimfits/dist/cjs/slimfits.d.ts`

# Building from sources

You can use bundles straight from  dist or consume using npm. But if you want to change something and build from TypeScript sources here's the way:

1. Clone this repository.
2. `npm install` in the directory
