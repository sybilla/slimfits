# slimfits
JavaScript library for loading data stored in [FITS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS) data format. FITS files are commonly used in astronomical observations to store scientific data.

# Prerequisites

- Node.js

# Consuming from npm

`npm install slimfits`

# Building from sources

You can use bundles straight from  dist or consume using npm. But if you want to change something and build from TypeScript sources here's the way:

1. Clone this repository.
2. `npm install` in the directory
3. Version for different compile targets will appear in dist
